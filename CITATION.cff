abstract: >-
  This tool will use `metacatalog` to load datasets stored in a metacatalog instance, like V-FOR-WaTer.
  The requested datasources will be made available in the output directory of the tool. Areal datasets
  will be clipped to the **bounding box** of the reference area and multi-file sources are preselected
  to fall into the time range specified. 
  Note that exact extracts (specific time step, specific area) are not yet supported for areal datasets.
