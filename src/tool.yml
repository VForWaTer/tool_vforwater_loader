    title: Dataset Loader
    description: |
      This tool will use `metacatalog` to load datasets stored in a metacatalog instance, like V-FOR-WaTer.
      The requested datasources will be made available in the output directory of the tool. Areal datasets
      will be clipped to the **bounding box** of the reference area and multi-file sources are preselected
      to fall into the time range specified. 
      Note that exact extracts (specific time step, specific area) are not yet supported for areal datasets.
    parameters:
      dataset_ids: 
        type: integer
        array: true
      reference_area:
        type: struct
        description: |
          The reference area can be any valid GeoJSON POLYGON geometry. Datasets that contain areal information will be clipped to this area.
          Be aware, that some remote sensing datasets may have global coverage. If you omit this parameter, the full dataset will be loaded,
          if the hosting server allows it.
          Please make sure, that you only pass one FEATURE. FeatureCollections are not supported yet.
        optional: true
      start_date:
        type: datetime
        description: |
          The start date of the datasetm, if a time dimension applies to the dataset.
      end_date:
        type: datetime
        description: |
          The end date of the datasetm, if a time dimension applies to the dataset.
      cell_touches:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          If set to true, the tool will only return datasets that have a spatial overlap with the reference area.
          If set to false, the tool will return datasets that have a spatial overlap or touch the reference area.
          If omitted, the default is true.
          Note: This parameter only applies to datasets with a defined spatial scale extent.
        optional: true
