    title: Loader for datasets stored in a metacatalog instance 
    description: This tool will use `metacatalog` to load datasets stored in a metacatalog instance, like V-FOR-WaTer.
    parameters:
      dataset_ids: 
        type: integer
        array: true
      reference_area:
        type: struct
        description: |
          The reference area can be any valid GeoJSON POLYGON geometry. Datasets that contain areal information will be clipped to this area.
          Be aware, that some remote sensing datasets may have global coverage. If you omit this parameter, the full dataset will be loaded,
          if the hosting server allows it.
          Please make sure, that you only pass one FEATURE. FeatureCollections are not supported yet.
        optional: true
      start_date:
        type: datetime
        description: |
          The start date of the datasetm, if a time dimension applies to the dataset.
      end_date:
        type: datetime
        description: |
          The end date of the datasetm, if a time dimension applies to the dataset.
      connection:
        type: string
        optional: true
        description: | 
          To connect to the V-FOR-WaTer database, you need to provide a connection URI. These URIs should be saved to an evnironment variable
          called `VFW_POSTGRES_URI`. Alternatively, you can pass in a file path to an `.env` file that contains the connection URI. 
          Passing the string directly as this parameter is technically also possible, but not recommended.
