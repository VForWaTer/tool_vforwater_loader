# Copernicus DEM example

This example incldues a installer service that loads an example Copernicus 30m-DEM for Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg
to metacatalog. 

Other than the HYRAS example, the script **does not download** the DEM to the folder, as you need to authenticate
to be able to download. Once you have a DEM, put it in the `./data/raster/DEM` folder, as the upload notebook uses
a hard-coded `/data/raster/DEM/*.tif` path (mounted inside the container) to find the files. If you store the data 
somewhere else, you need to change the mount point in the docker compose file.

To install the example, run:

```
cd examples/dem
docker compose up -d
```

Right now I can't figure out how to make the intsaller service wait until the db service is healthy.
Thus, after the thing is running, check the logs. The installer might have complained that the
db is not there. Then, invoke the installer manually, until that issue is resolved.

```
docker compose run --rm installer
```

The same thing applies to the actual examples. I can't figure out a way, how they could `depend_on: installer`,
in a way, that they wait until the installer has *finished*. 
Hence, their default command is overwritten to just echo the command that one would need to actually run the tool.

Long story short: To run one of the examples, with the `/examples/dem` compose cluster running, you can:

```
cd examples/dem
docker compose run --rm dede210080_loader python run.py
```
